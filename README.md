# Mofang's Garden

Your objective is to clear the board.

Nodes are only free and selectable if they have three or more contiguous free spaces neighboring them. Spaces off the board
count as free.

Elemental nodes match with the element they destroy. They also match with Creation to turn into the next node in the cycle.

Heavenly, Earthly, and Human nodes match in a triplet. They also match with Creation: Heavenly -> Earthly -> Human -> Heavenly.
In addition, Heavenly matches with Yang, and Earthly with Yin. Human matches with any element,
becoming that element. The matched element only requires 2 free neighbors.

Yin and Yang match to form 2 Creation.

Creation matches with itself. It does not start on the board; you must match Yin and Yang to get it.

Qi is only free if it has 1 neighbor. It cancels with itself.

One Destruction appears in the middle of the board. It matches with one of each Elemental node.
